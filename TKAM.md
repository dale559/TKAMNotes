## Quotes
> "Then why did Cecil say you defended niggers? He made it sound like you were  runnin‘ a still.” Atticus sighed. “I’m simply defending a Negro"

> "Try fighting with your head for a change… it’s a good one, even if it does  resist learning.”

> "You gotta make me first!” he yelled. “My folks said your daddy was a disgrace  an‘ that nigger oughta hang from the water-tank!”

> "like that. You want to grow up to be a lady, don’t you?” I said not particularly.

> Atticus speak sharply to anyone was when I once heard him say, “Sister, I do the  best I can with them!” It had something to do with my going around in overalls.

> “Boys don’t cook.” I giggled at the thought of Jem in an apron.

> "Hes ruining the family"

> "What’s a whore-lady?” Uncle Jack plunged into another long tale about an old Prime Minister who sat in  the House of Commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there  when all about him men were losing their heads. I guess he was trying to answer  my question, but he made no sense whatsoever.

> Hotheadedness isn’t. Scout’s got to learn to keep her  head and learn soon, with what’s in store for her these next few months. She’s  coming along, though.

> Why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a  Negro comes up, is something I don’t pretend to understand… I just hope that  Jem and Scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town.

## Quotes
>  Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but  remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” 

> “Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music  for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they  don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a  mockingbird.”

> I thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth, galloped, leaped and lunged at throats,  and I thought they did it in August. Had Tim Johnson behaved thus, I would have been less frightened.

> I think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that God had given him  an unfair advantage over most living things. I guess he decided he wouldn’t shoot 

> Jem said, “I reckon if he’d wanted us to know it, he’da told us. If he was proud of  it, he’da told us.” “Maybe it just slipped his mind,” I said. “Naw, Scout, it’s something you wouldn’t understand. Atticus is real old, but I  wouldn’t care if he couldn’t do anything—I wouldn’t care if he couldn’t do a  blessed thing.”

## Quotes 

> Overnight, it seemed, Jem had acquired an alien set of values  and was trying to impose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me  what to do. After one altercation when Jem hollered, “It’s time you started bein‘ a  girl and acting right!” 

> In addition to Jem’s newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a  maddening air of wisdom.

> He said, “Brethren and sisters, we are particularly glad to have company with us  this morning. Mister and Miss Finch. You all know their father. Before I begin I 

> “You all know what it’s for—Helen can’t leave those  children to work while Tom’s in jail. If everybody gives one more dime, we’ll  have it—”

> “Old Mr. Bob Ewell accused him of rapin‘ his girl an’ had him  arrested an‘ put in jail—”

> “Mr. Ewell?” My memory stirred. “Does he have anything to do with those  Ewells that come every first day of school an‘ then go home? Why, Atticus said  they were absolute trash—I never heard Atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the Ewells. He said -"

> That Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea that she  had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one, to say nothing of  her having command of two languages. “Cal,” I asked, “why do you talk nigger- talk to the—to your folks when you know it’s not right?” “Well, in the first place I’m black—”

> “It’s not necessary to tell all you know. It’s not ladylike—in the second place,  folks don’t like to have somebody around knowin‘ more than they do. It  aggravates ’em. You’re not gonna change any of them by talkin‘ right, they’ve  got to want to learn themselves, and when they don’t want to learn there’s nothing

## Quotes

> Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose  her coming to live with us was in that category.

> Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford’s tendency to mind  other people’s business was hereditary, Atticus said, “Sister, when you stop to  think about it, our generation’s practically the first in the Finch family not to  marry its cousins. Would you say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?” Aunty said no, that’s where we got our small hands and feet.

> There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way:  the older citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for  years and years, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted  attitudes, character shadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each  generation and refined by time. 

> “Why, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he tried to shoot the president. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasn’t anything but a sewer- inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in  his hand. Atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that  one—”

> "Atticus, is all this behavin‘ an’ stuff gonna make things different? I mean are you —?” I felt his hand on the back of my head. “Don’t you worry about anything,” he  said. “It’s not time to worry.” When I heard that, I knew he had come back to us.

I-got-you-that-book-so-go-read-it.” Dill tried to  deepen his voice. “You’re not a boy. Boys get out and play baseball with other  boys, they don’t hang around the house worryin’ their folks.”

> Scout,  let’s get us a baby.” “Where?” There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy  island where all these babies were; you could order one— “That’s a lie. Aunty said God drops ‘em down the chimney. At least that’s what I  think she said.” For once, Aunty’s diction had not been too clear.

> “Why do you reckon Boo Radley’s never run off?” Dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me. “Maybe he doesn’t have anywhere to run off to…”

> Atticus called, “Go back in the house.”

> “…in favor of Southern womanhood as much as anybody, but not for preserving  polite fiction at the expense of human life,” a pronouncement that made me  suspect they had been fussing again.

> “H-ey, Atticus!” I thought he would have a fine surprise, but his face killed my joy. A flash of  plain fear was going out of his eyes, but returned when Dill and Jem wriggled into  the light.

> “I’ll tell him you said hey, little lady,” he said. Then he straightened up and waved a big paw. “Let’s clear out,” he called. “Let’s  get going, boys.”

> A soft husky voice came from the darkness above: “They gone?” Atticus stepped back and looked up. “They’ve gone,” he said. “Get some sleep,  Tom. They won’t bother you any more.”
