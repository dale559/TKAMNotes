> "Then why did Cecil say you defended niggers? He made it sound like you were  runnin‘ a still.” Atticus sighed. “I’m simply defending a Negro"

> "Try fighting with your head for a change… it’s a good one, even if it does  resist learning.”

> "You gotta make me first!” he yelled. “My folks said your daddy was a disgrace  an‘ that nigger oughta hang from the water-tank!”

> "like that. You want to grow up to be a lady, don’t you?” I said not particularly.

> Atticus speak sharply to anyone was when I once heard him say, “Sister, I do the  best I can with them!” It had something to do with my going around in overalls.

> “Boys don’t cook.” I giggled at the thought of Jem in an apron.

> "Hes ruining the family"

> "What’s a whore-lady?” Uncle Jack plunged into another long tale about an old Prime Minister who sat in  the House of Commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there  when all about him men were losing their heads. I guess he was trying to answer  my question, but he made no sense whatsoever.

> Hotheadedness isn’t. Scout’s got to learn to keep her  head and learn soon, with what’s in store for her these next few months. She’s  coming along, though.

> Why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a  Negro comes up, is something I don’t pretend to understand… I just hope that  Jem and Scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town.

## Motif

## Quotes
>  Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but  remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” 

> “Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music  for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they  don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a  mockingbird.”

> I thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth, galloped, leaped and lunged at throats,  and I thought they did it in August. Had Tim Johnson behaved thus, I would have been less frightened.

> I think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that God had given him  an unfair advantage over most living things. I guess he decided he wouldn’t shoot 

> Jem said, “I reckon if he’d wanted us to know it, he’da told us. If he was proud of  it, he’da told us.” “Maybe it just slipped his mind,” I said. “Naw, Scout, it’s something you wouldn’t understand. Atticus is real old, but I  wouldn’t care if he couldn’t do anything—I wouldn’t care if he couldn’t do a  blessed thing.”

>“Easy does it, son,” Atticus would say. “She’s an old lady and she’s ill. You just hold your head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says to you, it’s your job not to let her make you mad.” (103)

> “Don’t you contradict me!” Mrs. Dubose bawled. “And you—” she pointed an arthritic finger at me—“what are you doing in those overalls? You should be in adress and camisole, young lady! You’ll grow up waiting on tables if somebody doesn’t change your ways—a Finch waiting on tables at the O.K. Café—hah!” I was terrified. The O.K. Café was a dim organization on the north side of the square. I grabbed Jem’s hand but he shook me loose. “Come on, Scout,” he whispered. “Don’t pay any attention to her, just hold your head high and be a gentleman.” But Mrs. Dubose held us: “Not only a Finch waiting on tables but one in the courthouse lawing for niggers!”

>said Atticus, “when summer comes you’ll have to keep your head about far worse things... it’s not fair for you and Jem, I know that, but sometimes we have to make the best of things, and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are down—well, all I can say is, when you and Jem are grown, maybe you’ll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that I didn’t let you down. This case, Tom Robinson’s case, is something that goes to the essence of a man’s conscience—Scout, I couldn’t go to church and worship God if I didn’t try to help that man.” (108)

> I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it, what made him break the bonds of “You just be a gentleman, son,” and the phase of selfconscious rectitude he had recently entered. Jem had probably stood as much guff about Atticus lawing for niggers as had I, and I took it for granted that he kept his temper—he had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. At the time, however, I thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he simply went mad.

>“They’re certainly entitled to think that, and they’re entitled to full respect for their opinions,” said Atticus, “but before I can live with other folks I’ve got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.” (108)
		 	 	 						
>“Read to her?” “Yes sir. She wants me to come every afternoon after school and Saturdays and read to her out loud for two hours. Atticus, do I have to?” “Certainly.” (109)

> Overnight, it seemed, Jem had acquired an alien set of values  and was trying to impose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me  what to do. After one altercation when Jem hollered, “It’s time you started bein‘ a  girl and acting right!” 

> In addition to Jem’s newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a  maddening air of wisdom.

> “Old Mr. Bob Ewell accused him of rapin‘ his girl an’ had him  arrested an‘ put in jail—”

> “Mr. Ewell?” My memory stirred. “Does he have anything to do with those  Ewells that come every first day of school an‘ then go home? Why, Atticus said  they were absolute trash—I never heard Atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the Ewells. He said -"

> That Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea that she  had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one, to say nothing of  her having command of two languages. “Cal,” I asked, “why do you talk nigger- talk to the—to your folks when you know it’s not right?” “Well, in the first place I’m black—”

> “It’s not necessary to tell all you know. It’s not ladylike—in the second place,  folks don’t like to have somebody around knowin‘ more than they do. It  aggravates ’em. You’re not gonna change any of them by talkin‘ right, they’ve  got to want to learn themselves, and when they don’t want to learn there’s nothing

## Quotes

> Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose  her coming to live with us was in that category.

> Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford’s tendency to mind  other people’s business was hereditary, Atticus said, “Sister, when you stop to  think about it, our generation’s practically the first in the Finch family not to  marry its cousins. Would you say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?” Aunty said no, that’s where we got our small hands and feet.

> There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way:  the older citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for  years and years, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted  attitudes, character shadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each  generation and refined by time. 

> “Why, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he tried to shoot the president. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasn’t anything but a sewer- inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in  his hand. Atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that  one—”

> "Atticus, is all this behavin‘ an’ stuff gonna make things different? I mean are you —?” I felt his hand on the back of my head. “Don’t you worry about anything,” he  said. “It’s not time to worry.” When I heard that, I knew he had come back to us.

> Scout,  let’s get us a baby.” “Where?” There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy  island where all these babies were; you could order one— “That’s a lie. Aunty said God drops ‘em down the chimney. At least that’s what I  think she said.” For once, Aunty’s diction had not been too clear.

> Atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come along, but Aunty said, “Nonsense, Mr. Underwood was there all the time.”“You know, it’s a funny thing about Braxton,” said Atticus. “He despises Negroes, won’t have one near him.

> he waited until Calpurnia was in the kitchen, then she said, “Don’t talk like that in front of them.” “Talk like what in front of whom?” he asked. “Like that in front of Calpurnia. You said Braxton Underwood despises Negroes right in front of her.” “Well, I’m sure Cal knows it. Everybody in Maycomb knows it.”

> My father put down his knife. “I don’t know of any law that says they can’t talk. Maybe if we didn’t give them so much to talk about they’d be quiet. Why don’t you drink your coffee, Scout?”

> “He might have hurt me a little,” Atticus conceded, “but son, you’ll understand folks a little better when you’re older. A mob’s always made up of people, no  matter what. Mr. Cunningham was part of a mob last night, but he was still a man. Every mob in every little Southern town is always made up of people you know— doesn’t say much for them, does it?”

> “You can’t sometimes, not unless you know who they are. But he’s half Raymond, all right.” “But how can you tell?” I asked. “I told you, Scout, you just hafta know who they are.” “Well how do you know we ain’t Negroes?”

> “Uncle Jack Finch says we really don’t know. He says as far as he can trace back the Finches we ain’t, but for all he knows we mighta come straight out of Ethiopia  durin‘ the Old Testament.” “Well if we came out durin‘ the Old Testament it’s too long ago to matter.” “That’s what I thought,” said Jem, “but around here once you have a drop of Negro blood, that makes you all black.

> I thought it odd that he hadn’t said anything to us about it— we could have used it many times in defending him and ourselves. He had to, that’s why he was doing it, equaled fewer fights and less fussing. But did that explain the town’s attitude? The court appointed Atticus to defend him. Atticus aimed to defend him. That’s what they didn’t like about it. It was confusing
